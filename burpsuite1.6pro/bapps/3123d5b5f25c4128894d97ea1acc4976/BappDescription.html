<p>This extension extends Burp's active and passive scanning capabilities. It adds checks for the following issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Host header attacks (password reset poisoning, cache poisoning, DNS rebinding)</li>
	<li>OS command injection (this complements Burp's coverage)</li>
    <li>CVE-2014-6271/CVE-2014-6278 'shellshock' and CVE-2015-2080</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than risking numerous false negatives by attempting to automate 
relative path overwrite and Host header attacks from start to finish, the
extension identifies key vulnerability components and flags these for user 
review.</p>

<p>This extension requires Burp Suite Professional (version 1.6 or later) and Jython 2.5 or later.</p>
